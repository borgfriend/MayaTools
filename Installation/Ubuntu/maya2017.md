# Quick installation:
```
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/borgfriend/b83467639cb8039dc79974bf780a4994/raw/fdb608b9ab0c02c4a9237b54ab98d680ef608b11/maya2017install.sh
sudo chmod +x maya2017install.sh
sudo ./maya2017install.sh
```
**Warning:** Do not run the script as `su`, this will change the home directory and messes up the script.

# Post Install:
## Display Drivers
Nvidia: Ensure that the proprietary drivers are enabled (Software & Updates > Additional Drivers)
 
## Start Maya
Run Maya by simply typing `maya` or via the Application Launcher. 

**Important**: **DO NOT:** run maya as root or with sudo, if you initially launch maya with sudo something with the initial setup goes wrong and maya usually crashes when starting from the Application Launcher.

## Remove Installation Files
The install files are not removed by the script. This avoids the issue of re-downloading the files if the script crashes. (Remove line 21-22 from the script)

If the script should crash, please post a comment in which line it caused the issue and (if possible) which steps helped that you did not run into the issue again. 


## Uninstall Maya
```
sudo apt remove adlm*
sudo apt remove maya2017-64
```
